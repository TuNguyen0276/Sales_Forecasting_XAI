# Sales Forecasting with Explainable AI: A Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview

- This project simulates a real-world data science proof of concept (PoC) aimed at forecasting daily retail sales using historical sales data and weather conditions. The primary goal is not only to build an accurate predictive model, but also to **interpret and explain** its behavior using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

- Through this project, students and practitioners will experience the full PoC cycle‚Äîfrom data exploration to model building and explanation‚Äîreflecting industry practices for validating the viability of AI solutions before scaling.

## Objectives

- Build a reliable forecasting model for store-level, item-specific daily sales.
- Analyze the relationship between external features (e.g. weather, time, seasonality) and sales behavior.
- Use **Explainable AI** to interpret predictions and understand model decision-making.
- Present findings that can support data-driven decisions for stakeholders.

### üìÅ Data Description

**1. Sales Data (2016 & 2017)**

- `date`, `province`, `store_id`, `store_name`
- `category`, `item_id`, `item_name`, `sales`

**2. Weather Data**

- `date`, `city`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `season`

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept

### 1. **Data Integration & Cleaning**

- Convert dates to time features (e.g., day of week, month, holiday).
- Handle missing values, incorrect types, and inconsistent entries.
- Handle outlier values.
- Merge sales and weather data by date and location.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

- Visualize time series trends: weekly/seasonal patterns, top-performing items.
- Correlate weather features (temperature, humidity) with sales variation.
- Identify outliers and data anomalies.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**

- Create derived features:
  - Date and time related features
    - Calendar: `day_of_week`, `day_of_month` ,`is_weekend`, `is_holiday`, etc
  - Sales related features
    - Last n days sales. lst_days=[1, 7, 14, 21, 28]
    - Recent mean, min, max, std sales in n days. n=7, 14, 280
    - Exponentially weighted moving average sales. lst_days=[3, 7, 14, 28], alphas=[0.5, 0.75, 0.9]
  - Stores and items related features
    - Mean and Sum store sales in 7 days
    - Mean and Sum of 7 days item sales
    - Stores and items encoding
  - Weather-based: `temp_category`, `humidity_level`

### 4. **Modeling**

- Build a base line mode: LightGBM for data without feature engineering.
- Build a better model with feature enginnering use LightGBM
- Parameter tunning using Optuna
- Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, WAPE and cross-validation.

### 5. **Explainable AI (XAI)**

- Apply **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** or **LIME** to interpret:
  - **Global feature importance**: Which features consistently influence predictions?
  - **Local explanations**: Why did the model predict a high/low sales value for a particular day?
  - **Temporal patterns**: How does the effect of weather or season change over time?

### 6. **Reporting & Recommendations**

- Summarize forecast accuracy and key driving factors.
- Provide visual explanations for predictions using SHAP plots.
- Evaluate whether the model is interpretable and actionable enough for business stakeholders.
- Recommend whether to proceed with full-scale development (Phase 2).
