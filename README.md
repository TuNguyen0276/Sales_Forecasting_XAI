# Sales Forecasting with Explainable AI (XAI)

- **Author:** TuNguyen0276
- **Project Type:** Proof of Concept (PoC)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, LightGBM, SHAP, Optuna, Streamlit

## Overview

- **Sales Forecasting with Explainable AI (XAI)** is a complete end-to-end proof of concept (PoC) that leverages machine learning to forecast store-level sales with transparency and interpretability.

- The project combines time series modeling with explainability tools to provide actionable insights, making it easier for business stakeholders to understand and trust the modelâ€™s predictions.

- At its core, this project builds a sales forecasting model using **LightGBM**, optimized with **Optuna**, and explained using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**. It culminates in a **Streamlit web application** that allows users to explore historical sales and prediction results by store.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
  Integration of multiple data sources (sales, weather), missing value handling, outlier detection.

* **Feature Engineering:**
  Over 50 crafted features including date, lag, rolling stats, and weather-based inputs.

* **Time Series Modeling:**
  Sales forecasting using LightGBM with careful temporal train/test splitting.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  Efficient model optimization via **Optuna** for enhanced performance.

* **Explainability with SHAP:**
  Interpretable model predictions with local and global SHAP value analysis.

* **Interactive Streamlit App:**
  A web interface (`app.py`) that enables users to explore store-level forecasts and historical trends.

## Deliverables

- 5 comprehensive notebooks for data processing, feature engineering, modelling and evaluation
- Trained LightGBM model
- SHAP explainability visuals - ðŸ“„ [SHAP Analysis Summary Report](docs/shap_analysis_summary_report.md)
- Streamlit app for predictions

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TuNguyen0276/sales_forecasting_xai.git
   cd sales_forecasting_xai
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**

- For general systems:

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate sales_forecast
  ```

- For Mac M1:

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment_macm1.yml
  conda activate sales_forecast
  ```

  _You need to install Anaconda for this setup. If not, please use the below setup instead._

- Create a virtual environment using pure python

  ```
  python -m venv .venv

  # On macOS/Linux:
  source .venv/bin/activate

  # On Windows:
  .venv\Scripts\activate

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the notebooks**

- After activating virtual enviroments

  ```bash
  jupyter lab
  ```

4. **Generate your all dataset**

- If you preferer generating your all dataset, you can change the range of data as well as the outlier and nan values ratio.
- In this case, modify `src/data_generator/data_generator.py `, and in below `sales_forecasting_xai` folder, run the below command

  ```bash
  python src/data_generator/data_generator.py
  ```

5. **Run the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Pipeline**
   Sales and weather data are preprocessed and merged. Features are engineered and saved for model training.

2. **Model Training**
   LightGBM is trained using time-aware train/test split. Optuna tunes the model for best performance.

3. **Explainability**
   SHAP values are calculated and visualized to explain predictions at both global and local levels.

4. **User Interface**

- `app.py` allows users to:
  - View historical sales
  - Make a predictions of future sales to properly arrange the resources
